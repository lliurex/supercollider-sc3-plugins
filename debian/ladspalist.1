.TH LADSPALIST 1
.SH NAME
ladspalist \- find LADSPA plugins info for use by SuperCollider
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ladspalist
.SH USAGE
.B ladspalist | less
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The LADSPA UGen lets you run any LADSPA plugin inside SuperCollider.
Run the
.I ladspalist
utility in a shell to find the info about the plugin you want.
.PP
For example, glame lowpass iir with ID 1891:
.PP
  # 1891 Glame Lowpass Filter
  > k: Cutoff Frequency (0.0001 to 0.45)
  > k: Stages(2 poles per stage) (1 to 10)
  > a: Input
  < a: Output
.PP
The meaning of the first two characters for each port are:
.PP
  '>' \- input
  '<' \- output
  'k' \- controlrate
  'a' \- audiorate
.PP
Use it in SuperCollider:
.PP
  play{
    LADSPA.ar(
      1, 1891,
      1000+LFNoise1.kr(10, 800),
      2, WhiteNoise.ar(1!2)
    )
  }
.PP
Note that the first arg is the number of output audio channels, then
the UniqueID, the rest is all the inputs in the same order as shown in
.I ladspalist.
Currently, controlrate outputs are ignored.
.PP
If the plugin doesn't provide the requested number of channels, the
extra channels will be silenced.
.PP
If the plugin provides more than requested number of channels, the
extra channels will be ignored.
.SH WARNING
Some LADSPA plugins might not be real-time safe, if they allocate
memory at initialization.
